Analyze the Winning Numbers of Mega Million, finding meaningful insights in data & visualizing it for complex information easier to understand. This Excel Visualization Dashboard allows us to identify patterns, trends, and outliers that might be difficult to see in raw data.

## Process
-	Imported Raw data from the data source
-	Transformed and cleaned data “used Text to column Excel Function” to separate conjoined data
-	Extracted meaningful insights using “CountIF, Index, Match, VLOOKUP, MODE” functions visible in the worksheet
-	Created Pivot Tables and visualized the data in the dashboard

## Questions
-	What number is most frequent in the winning sequence?
-	What number is the least frequent in the winning sequence?
-	What Mega Ball number is the most frequent?
-	How many times have those numbers appeared in the winning sequence?

## Insights
-	31 is the most appeared number in the winning sequence.
-	67 is the least appeared number in the winning sequence.
-	For some reason, higher numbers are less likely to be in the winning sequence.
The same goes for Mega Ball numbers, higher numbers are less likely to be in the winning sequence.

## Remarks:
A lot of my friends and my sister believe in their odds against gambling and lotteries. Although I’m personally not a supporter of Gambling and Lotteries because their odds are stacked up big time against a player, but I’m doing this project anyway to showcase my data analysis skills to my peers and my sister.
